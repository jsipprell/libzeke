libzeke: a high-level zookeeper library built around the Apache Portable Runtime to facilitate rapid development of fast dependency-light applications.

- NOTE: The "public" API exposed via libzeke.h and addl header files installed is currently incomplete and
        needs to be audited before it can be considered viable. Currently all zeke tools require additional private
        header files.

zklock: a utility built with libzeke that can perform locking via zookeeper and execute a command-line only while the lock is held.

zkelection: a utility built with libzeke that can examine solr-style election nodes, display the current election winner and "clean" duplicate/redundant election ephemeral nodes (caused by a solr4 bug).


zkjobs: see README in the zkjobs subdir, but basically this is a distributed job batching system using zookeeper.
